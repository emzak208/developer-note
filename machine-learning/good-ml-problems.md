A good machine learning problem can be defined as:

* There is an **abundance of data**, which is already labeled or where labels can be inferred.

* The data can be used to solve **real problems**.

* The problem relates to a **domain you are passionate about** or the problem you want to solve is your own and **you can be your first customer**.

* There is a **platform** where your data product can reach a **massive audience**, with mechanisms to **gather feedback and improve**.

* You can create this with **minimal expense and time**, hopefully using languages and tools you are familiar with.

* There is a way to **monetize your product** if it becomes successful.
